A command line interface for automatically extracting relevant metadata from code repositories (readme, configuration files, documentation, etc.).

**Demo:** See a [demo running somef as a service](https://somef.linkeddata.es), through the [SOMEF-Vider tool](https://github.com/SoftwareUnderstanding/SOMEF-Vider/). 

**Authors:** Daniel Garijo, Allen Mao, Miguel Ángel García Delgado, Haripriya Dharmala, Vedant Diwanji, Jiaying Wang, Aidan Kelley, Jenifer Tabita Ciuciu-Kiss and Luca Angheluta.

## Features
Given a readme file (or a GitHub/Gitlab repository) SOMEF will extract the following categories (if present), listed in alphabetical order:

- **Acknowledgement**: Text acknowledging funding sources or contributors
- **Application domain**: The application domain of the repository. Current supported domains include: Astrophisics, Audio, Computer vision, Graphs, Natural language processing, Reinforcement learning, Semantc web, Sequential. Domains are not mutually exclusive. These domains have been extracted from [awesome lists](https://github.com/topics/awesome-list) and [Papers with code](https://paperswithcode.com/). Find more information in our [documentation](https://somef.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- **Citation**: Preferred citation as the authors have stated in their readme file. SOMEF recognizes Bibtex, Citation File Format files and other means by which authors cite their papers (e.g., by in-text citation)
- **Code of Conduct**: Link to the code of conduct of the project
- **Code repository**: Link to the GitHub/GitLab repository used for the extraction

## Requirements

- Python 3.9 or Python 3.10 (default version support)

SOMEF has been tested on Unix, MacOS and Windows Microsoft operating systems.

If you face any issues when installing SOMEF, please make sure you have installed the following packages: `build-essential`, `libssl-dev`,  `libffi-dev` and `python3-dev`. 

## Install from Pypi
SOMEF [is available in Pypi!](https://pypi.org/project/somef/) To install it just type:

```
pip install somef
```

## Install from GitHub
To run SOMEF, please follow the next steps:

Clone this GitHub repository

```
git clone https://github.com/KnowledgeCaptureAndDiscovery/somef.git
```

Install somef (you should be in the folder that you just cloned). Note that for Python 3.7 and 3.8 the module Cython should be installed in advanced (through the command: `pip install Cython`).

```
cd somef
pip install -e .
```

Test SOMEF installation

```bash
somef --help
```

If everything goes fine, you should see:

```bash
Usage: somef [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  -h, --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  configure  Configure credentials
  describe   Running the Command Line Interface
  version    Show somef version.
```

## Installing through Docker
We provide a Docker image with SOMEF already installed. To run through Docker, you may build the Dockerfile provided in the repository by running:

```bash
docker build -t somef .
```
Or just use the Docker image already built in [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/kcapd/somef):

```bash
docker pull kcapd/somef
```

Then, to run your image just type:

```bash
docker run -it kcapd/somef /bin/bash
```

And you will be ready to use SOMEF (see section below). If you want to have access to the results we recommend [mounting a volume](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/). For example, the following command will mount the current directory as the `out` folder in the Docker image:

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v $PWD/:/out kcapd/somef /bin/bash
```
If you move any files produced by somef into `/out`, then you will be able to see them in your current directory.


## Configure

Before running SOMEF for the first time, you must **configure** it appropriately (you only need to do this once). Run:

```bash
somef configure
```

And you will be asked to provide the following:

- A GitHub authentication token [**optional, leave blank if not used**], which SOMEF uses to retrieve metadata from GitHub. If you don't include an authentication token, you can still use SOMEF. However, you may be limited to a series of requests per hour. For more information, see [https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line)
- The path to the trained classifiers (pickle files). If you have your own classifiers, you can provide them here. Otherwise, you can leave it blank

If you want somef to be automatically configured (without GitHUb authentication key and using the default classifiers) just type:

```bash
somef configure -a
```

For showing help about the available options, run:

```bash
somef configure --help
```
Which displays:

```bash
Usage: somef configure [OPTIONS]

  Configure GitHub credentials and classifiers file path

Options:
  -a, --auto  Automatically configure SOMEF
  -h, --help  Show this message and exit.
```

### Updating SOMEF
If you update SOMEF to a newer version, we recommend you `configure` again the library (by running `somef configure`). The rationale is that different versions may rely on classifiers which may be stored in a different path. 

## Usage

```bash
$ somef describe --help
  SOMEF Command Line Interface
Usage: somef describe [OPTIONS]

  Running the Command Line Interface

Options:
  -t, --threshold FLOAT           Threshold to classify the text  [required]
  Input: [mutually_exclusive, required]
    -r, --repo_url URL            Github/Gitlab Repository URL
    -d, --doc_src PATH            Path to the README file source
    -i, --in_file PATH            A file of newline separated links to GitHub/
                                  Gitlab repositories

  Output: [required_any]
    -o, --output PATH             Path to the output file. If supplied, the
                                  output will be in JSON

    -c, --codemeta_out PATH       Path to an output codemeta file
    -g, --graph_out PATH          Path to the output Knowledge Graph export
                                  file. If supplied, the output will be a
                                  Knowledge Graph, in the format given in the
                                  --format option chosen (turtle, json-ld)

  -f, --graph_format [turtle|json-ld]
                                  If the --graph_out option is given, this is
                                  the format that the graph will be stored in

  -p, --pretty                    Pretty print the JSON output file so that it
                                  is easy to compare to another JSON output
                                  file.

  -m, --missing                   The JSON will include a field 
                                  somef_missing_categories to report with the 
                                  missing metadata fields that SOMEF was not 
                                  able to find.

  -kt, --keep_tmp PATH            SOMEF will NOT delete the temporary folder
                                  where files are stored for analysis. Files
                                  will be stored at the
                                  desired path


  -h, --help                      Show this message and exit.
```

## Usage example:
The following command extracts all metadata available from [https://github.com/dgarijo/Widoco/](https://github.com/dgarijo/Widoco/).

```bash
somef describe -r https://github.com/dgarijo/Widoco/ -o test.json -t 0.8
```
