# Termlex, an OntoLex-lemon module to represent terminologies

This repository is intended to collect material that supports the development of the Termlex module, a an extension proposal of OntoLex-lemon to cover the current gaps regarding the publication of terminological resources in Semantic Web formats.
The work started in October 2020 as part of the NexusLinguarum Action (http://nexuslinguarum.eu/), that supported the development with the founding of an short term scientific mission amongst the main institutions behind the work: UPM (Universidad Politécnica de Madrid) and DFKI (Deutsches Forschungszentrum für Künstliche Intelligenz).

The repo contains the preliminary ontology in Turtle, and some use cases examples in the same format. 
These files are support the ongoing publication to present this module. More info about the proposal can be found in the Ontology Lexica Community Group Wiki page: https://www.w3.org/community/ontolex/wiki/Terminology
